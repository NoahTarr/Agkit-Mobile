## Label Definitions:  
**bug**: Something is broken and needs to be fixed.  

**new feature**: A new feature or request for a new feature to add. These are never bug fixes but instead ideas for things to add in the future.  

**optimization**: Reformatting or making improvements to what we already have.  

**styling**: Front end styling and UX design and features. These are purely visual additions to the website.  

**misc**: Anything that does not fit in the other labels.  

**wontfix**: This issue will never be worked on.  

## Priorities
Attach a priority label to all issues apart from *wontfix* signifying the importance of the issue.  

**Priority Critical**  
* Critical customer/product impact. This indicates you are unable to use the overall product resulting in a critical impact on operations. This condition requires an immediate solution.  
* The product is unable to operate or the product caused other critical software to fail and there is no acceptable way to work around the problem.  

**Priority High**  
* Significant customer/product impact. This indicates the product is usable but is severely limited.  
* Severely limited can mean that a task is unable to operate, the task caused other critical software to fail, or the task is usable but not without severe difficulty.  
* A serious performance degradation might fall into this category unless it was so bad as to render the system completely inoperative.  
* This can mean that function which you were attempting to use failed to function, but a temporary workaround is available.  

**Priority Medium**  
* Some product impact. This indicates the program is usable but a task runs with minor issues/limitations.  
* The task that you were attempting to use behaved in a manner which is incorrect and/or unexpected, or presented misleading or confusing information. 
* This can include documentation that was incomplete or incorrect, making it difficult to know how to use a task.  
* This can include poor or unexplained log messages where no clear error was evident.  
* This can include situations where some side effect is observed which does not significantly harm operations.  
* Documentation that causes the customer to perform some operation which damages data (unintentional deletion, corruption, etc.) would more likely be listed as a severity 2 problem.  
* This can not include cases where customer data is inaccurately stored, or retrieved. Data integrity problems require a severity of 2 or higher.  

**Priority Low**
* Minimal product impact. This indicates the problem causes little impact on operations or that a reasonable circumvention to the problem has been implemented.  
* The function you were attempting to use suffers from usability quirks, requires minor documentation updates or could be enhanced with some minor changes to the function.  
* This is also the place for general Help/DOC suggestions where data is NOT missing or incorrect.
